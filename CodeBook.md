#This is the code book for the project

Download data from the link below and unzip it into working directory of R Studio.

About the source data
		The source data are from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. 
		
		A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 
				http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
		Here are the data for the project: 
				https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 9 steps required.

1) Download the dataset
			Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

2) Read all required files and assign it to data frame
				features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
						The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
				activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
						List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)
				subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
						contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
				x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
						contains recorded features test data
				y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
						contains test data of activities’code labels
				subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
						contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
				x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
						contains recorded features train data
				y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
						contains train data of activities code labels

3) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
				x (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
				y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
				subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
				merged_data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging subject, y and x using cbind() function

4) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
				req_meas (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting merged_data, 
								selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

5) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
				Entire numbers in code column of the req_meas replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

6) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
				code column in req_meas renamed into activities
				All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
				All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
				All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
				All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
				All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
				All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

7) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
			final_tidy_data (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing req_meas taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
8) Export final_tidy_data into FinalData.txt file.
